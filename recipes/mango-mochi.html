        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Mochi</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>mango puree (mine was from fresh mangoes)</li>
            <li>sugar</li>
            <li>water</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>glutinous rice flour , a.k.a. sweet rice flour or mochiko flour</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Dusting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Corn starch or corn flour</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Filling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fresh ripe mango</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Garnish (Optional)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Mint leaves for topping, optional</li>
        </ul>
        

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare a large microwave safe bowl.</li>
            <li>Peel and slice the mango. I like to slice a checkered pattern on each mango “cheek” and scoop the flesh out with a spoon. This way, I can easily mash the mangoes using a potato mashed to make a puree.</li>
            <li>Add the mangoes to large bowl and mash until there are no longer any large chunks.</li>
            <li>Add the sugar, pinch of salt, and water into the mango puree. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Add in the glutinous rice flour and mix well to combine with the mango mixture. Once there are no signs of dry flour. Cover your bowl with a microwave safe cover.</li>
            <li>Microwave for 1 minute. After 1 minute, carefully mix the mango mochi mixture. After microwaving, mix the mochi mixture again. Cover the bowl and microwave for 1 minute again. The dough should be sticky and stretchy, but not wet.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl and then allow the mochi to cool for 30 minutes in a refrigerator. It’ll thicken as it cools and will be a lot easier to work with.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, prepare the mochi filling. I simply used 1 fresh ripe mango and cut each side into 6-8 large chunks to use as filling. You can refrigerate or freeze these if you want these hard. I simply refrigerated mine.</li>
            <li>Afterwards cooling the mochi dough, dust your flat surface with a generous amount of corn starch. This will prevent the mochi from sticking. Add in the mochi to the corn starch and sprinkle on some corn starch on the top as well. 
                You can dust your hands or a spatula with some corn starch before checking underneath that the mochi has not stuck to your surface. If it does, carefully scrape it out and coat with more corn starch.</li>
            <li>Lightly flatten the ball of mochi until around 0.5-inch (1.25 cm) thick. You can do this with your hands and dust with additional corn starch as needed. Divide the mochi dough into 8.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Folding the Mochi</h2>
        <p>I do recommend clicking the link above to view to photos of folding, but for completion's sake, here are the steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Get a piece, carefully flatten it more to stretch. I like to pinch the border/sides so that these are thinner and much easier to pinch together when sealing the mochi.</li>
            <li>Place the mochi wrapper on your palm. Add a chunk of mango in the centre and bring the edges together. From there, pinch the sides together to seal the mochi well.</li>
            <li>Flip over and then place on your palm or on a surface to flatten the base.</li>
            <li>Place the finished mochi on a plate or surface dusted with some corn starch to prevent from sticking.</li>
            <li>Repeat this for the rest. Garnish with a mint leaf, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Enjoy!!!</p>
