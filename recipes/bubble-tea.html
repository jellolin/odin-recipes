        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Water:</b> To make up the black tea base and prepare the brown sugar syrup.</li>
            <li><b>Milk:</b> You can use dairy or non-dairy milk (such as coconut milk, oat milk, almond milk, or soy milk) and adjust the fat level (i.e., skim, 2%, whole milk, etc.). For a super creamy boba milk tea, use half and half.</li>
            <li><b>Vanilla extract:</b> (optional) Add some natural vanilla extract for an even more dessert-like flavor.</li>
            <li><b>Brown Sugar:</b> You can use regular dark brown sugar or even dark muscovado sugar for a deeper, rich molasses flavor.</li>
            <li><b>Tapioca balls:</b> You can use store-bought quick-cook tapioca pearls (or regular ones, though they take much longer to cook), which can be found in many Asian grocery stores or online. Alternatively, make your own tapioca balls (which I do).</li>
            <li><b>Ice cubes:</b> Technically optional but a popular (and usual) addition to bubble milk tea.</li>
            <li><b>Boba tea straws</b> (There are reusable versions available) would also be a good idea. Otherwise, youâ€™ll need to serve the brown sugar boba tea with a spoon to fish out all the boba balls.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring water to just under a boil. Add the black tea (tea bags or tea leaves) into a teapot and then pour the water over them, leaving it to steep for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>If using quick cook boba pearls, cook them according to their package instructions (usually 3-5 minutes). Stir them occasionally to avoid sticking. Once cooked, drain and immediately transfer to a bowl of cold water or leave under running cold water. <i>This will help prevent them from sticking to one another.</i></li>
            <li>Add the water and brown sugar to a small saucepan and heat over medium heat. Stir occasionally until the brown sugar has completely dissolved and is simmering. Then cook for a further 3-4 minutes to slightly thicken up.
                Transfer the cooked tapioca balls to the syrup and mix well.</li>
            <li>In a tall glass (like a latte glass), add the brown sugar boba mixture to the bottom (or portion them out if making several servings). <i>The amount of brown sugar boba mixture you add is adaptable. However, I recommend around 1/3 cup boba/syrup mixture + 1 cup tea + around 1/4 cup milk and ice.</i> Then, pour the milk over the top and add your milk of choice.

                <p>Finally, stir well and enjoy!</p></li>
